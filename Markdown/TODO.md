## TODO

-   [x] clean up Sketch.js
-   [x] review InputManager.js
-   [x] integrate UI
-   [x] implement rotation
-   [x] implement algorithm for choosing pieces
-   [ ] implement locking player controls
-   [ ] implement sprite for cells or border

## ISSUES

-   [x] rotating out of bounds crashes everything
-   [x] clearing a line clears whole board instead
-   [x] rotating in the ground still crashes everything
